Guess a code with clues or try to stump the computer with a code of your own.

Download files and run main.rb to start a game or play a live version on [repl.it](https://repl.it/@QuentinPongratz/mastermind)

  More experience with object oriented programming.

### Learned:
  Definitely a lot more comfortable with OOP now.
  
  More comfortable using pry to debug.
